      <h1>Retribution</h1>
      <div class="byline">by Adrija Chakrabarty</div>
      <p>As she floated on a never-ending ocean, at the edge of consciousness, Lavanya felt a strange weightlessness envelop her. She tried to reach out to the surface but barely managed to hold it. The empty bottle, which was filled with pills an hour before, rolled beside her bedside lamp.</p>

    <p>In her half-conscious state, she was frustratingly cursing her brother, who prescribed the useless pills that she swallowed in desperation. 
        But alas, they didn’t deliver her the peace she sought. Instead…the pills threw her into an unsettling void. It tangled her up in the reality she so desperately desired to escape. When she opened her eyes, she found herself in a hospital room, to the beeping of the machines all around, the world felt... different. 
        The light was harsher, the colors too vibrant, almost blinding her eyes, and the faces of those around her seemed to ripple like the stone thrown on the surface of still water. Their face began to shift at a pace imperceptible to the eyes, as though they were hiding something beneath their skin.</p>

    <p>As days passed, Lavanya realized she could see more than she should. 
        The nurse who attended her suddenly had her face split open like an overripe fruit, revealing a tangle of worms writhing in a mass of despair. 
        Before she could scream at the disgusting sight, the scene shifted back to normalcy. 
        Her roommate’s reflection in the window didn’t mimic her physical movements but instead shrank, tangling itself up in invisible chains. People’s deepest fears unraveled before her like some grotesque theater performances, their secrets laid bare in front of her uninvited gaze.</p>

    <p>At first, Lavanya had a hard time distinguishing the real and the unreal. 
        Sometimes, the shadows stretched too far, sometimes the whispers grew the conversations. 
        For Lavanya, every face now had a mask, a mask concealing anguish, an inner pain, and she sometimes, unknowingly, opened up that cover. 
        But as the days went by, her curiosity took over the initial repulsion. She no longer fears what is hidden. She began to stare at doctors, at strangers, at visitors, at anyone who dared enter her orbit. Their fears played to her like private theatre performances, and Lavanya grew addicted to their rawness, their vulnerability.</p>

    <p>It was during these aimless walks around the city that her hatred brimmed up with new hope. Every step reminded her of the betrayals that had pushed her to commit the unthinkable act. Her father, who abandoned his family without even glancing back for a second. Her sister, who always found a way to make Lavanya feel small. Her boss, Rajiv, who built his entire career on her ideas, only to discard her like trash the moment she fought back. And then there was Aniket, the love of her life, or so she had thought, who promised her eternal promises, only to betray her for a match suited more to his parents.</p>

    <p>As she walked past the office building that she once called her own, Lavanya’s resolve for revenge grew even more. If the universe had cursed her with this sight, she would use it as her leverage. Not for good, not for redemption, but for revenge.</p>
    <p>When she was finally discharged, the city outside felt no less alien to her than inside the sterile rooms of the hospital. The chaotic streets of Delhi throbbed with life at every corner the eyes went through, but to Lavanya, it was a kaleidoscope of terror. Fear clung to the people around her like a second skin. A suited man walking down the footpath was stalked by faceless shadows; a child, no more than five years clutching his mother’s hand, screamed silently as his reflection, disfigured into a wolfish creature with blood-red eyes. Lavanya’s stomach churned, but her curiosity restrained her from looking away.</p>

 
    <p>Her first target was Rajiv. He was still the smug, insufferable man she remembered. He still spent his day mooching off the works of his underlings and barking orders in his pristine corner office. Lavanya waited until dusk, her body trembling with anticipation and excitement. When all the employees went to their homes, she slipped inside the building. Rajiv’s fear was palpable to Lavanya, even before she focused her vision. His shadow was stretched like a rubber band,  unnaturally pulled to a distance, towering all over him. His reflection in the glass windows convulsed violently.</p>

    <p>As she stepped closer, his fear bloomed right before her: Rajiv as a child, crouching under a massive wooden desk. A figure loomed above him,  probably his father, berating him for his failures. The young Rajiv sobbed, uncontrollably beneath the desk, desperately begging the domineering man in front, his face contorting in terror as the man slowly raised a cane.</p>

    <p>Lavanya smiled grimly. She didn’t even need to lift a finger. His fear was enough to devour him. She leaned forward, whispering, "He was right, you know. You’ll never be enough. You will always be the boy crouching under my desk." Rajiv’s eyes widened, and he stumbled back, his breaths becoming shallow with irregular gasps. The scene only perceptible to Lavanya, dissolved into chaos as Rajiv began to scream, choking at his voice, begging for forgiveness from invisible ghosts that only he could see.</p>

   
    <p>Her father came next. She followed him one day to a lavish bungalow, a life that he built on the rubble of her own family. Lavanya didn’t hesitate even for once. She knocked at the main entrance. She heard the footsteps approaching, and then he opened the door, barely recognizing his own daughter. His new wife hovered near the entrance, her face a mix of suspicion and disdain.</p>

    <p>But Lavanya had her own way of revenge. She didn't even need to speak. Her father’s fear roared at her, a tsunami of guilt, regret, and shame. He stood there on a deserted beach, nothing but dead carcasses nearby. The sand sparkled beneath his feet as waves crashed against the distant shore. From the clear water emerged her mother, Lavanya, and her sister, their faces pale, and their hands outstretched.</p>

    <p>"You left us," Lavanya whispered, her voice sharp like a dagger that can pierce through a soul. Her father collapsed right in front of her, sobbing into his hands as the invisible phantoms dragged him into the water built by his own guilt.</p>

    <p>With each act of vengeance, Lavanya felt a fleeting sense of satisfaction like never before, but slowly the line between her victims’ fears and her own began to blur. Initially, it started with a glitch, but then every time she invoked their nightmares, fragments of their fears clung to her, infecting her mind like a parasite that didn't intend to leave her. Sometimes Rajiv’s father appeared in her dreams, his cane snapping against her back. 
        Sometimes, her father’s ghosts followed her through the mirrors, their faces disfigured and skeletal.</p>

      
        <p>By the time she sought revenge against Aniket, Lavanya’s sanity had started unraveling. She cornered him outside his office, her voice icy and venomous. "Did you ever love me, or was I just a convenient choice?"</p>
    
        <p>Aniket’s fear spilled like vomit from his mouth, a wedding altar and flames, consuming it. Lavanya stood in the center, her maroon and gold saree turning into ash. Aniket, bound to invisible chains and gagged, watched helplessly as his family pushed him towards another woman, their faces distorted and melting by the flames.</p>
    
        <p>"You’re weak," Lavanya said bitterly, stepping closer. "You will always remain a coward."</p>
    
        <p>But as Aniket fell to his knees, sobbing, Lavanya stumbled a step back. The flames around the altar flickered, and then for a brief moment, it wasn’t Aniket who was bound by the chains, but it was her. She blinked repeatedly, but the image etched in her memory, her own reflection superimposed on his suffering.</p>
    
       
        <p>The more she used her gift...or curse, the more it consumed her from within. Her world became a fractured kaleidoscope of horrific nightmares. She could no longer walk down the street in curiosity. The shadows she once intriguely observed now wouldn’t let her sleep at night. The whispers would throb her ears. Her victims’ fears intertwined with her own, creating a labyrinth she couldn’t escape, no matter how hard she tried.</p>
    
        <p>Lavanya gradually isolated herself. She locked the doors at night, covered the windows with black tapes, but still…the visions didn’t stop. Shadows seeped through the walls of her apartment, faces pressed against the glass panel of her windows, and voices screamed her name from the void.</p>
    
        <p>One night, as she closed her eyes, she found herself swirling into an endless void. The air around felt thick and heavy with a putrid stench of rotten flesh. Figures emerged from every corner: Rajiv, her father, and Aniket. But all their faces were warped, had empty sockets for their eyes. They all pointed at her, chanting in a language she couldn’t comprehend.</p>
    
        <p>In the distance, she saw a mirror slowly floating towards her. Its surface rippled like water. She approached it cautiously, but the moment she tried to watch her reflection, it cracked open. In those cracks, Lavanya couldn’t see herself; instead, she saw the fears that she had once invoked, approaching her like a swirling tornado of torment.</p>
    
        <p>The reflections grinned at her. Their eyes gleaming with malice, and then it whispered softly, "Are you sure these aren’t your fears?"</p>
