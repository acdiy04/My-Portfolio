      <h1>The Lady and I</h1>
      <div class="byline">by Adrija Chakrabarty</div>
      <p>The rain began in the early afternoon—a soft, steady downpour that slowly cloaked the gloomy, narrow streets of Kalimpong with a curtain of mist. Life in these hills dragged on slowly, each passing moment arduously stretching into the next, with no sense of urgency.</p>
      <p>It was one of those lazy June afternoons when the air moistened heavily on your skin. My father, along with my grandparents, had gone to the city. There was a welcoming ceremony for an affluent figure visiting the Graham's Homes. It was a big event for our sleepy town, and nearly everyone went there, except for me. I was stuck at home, nursing a fever that came out of nowhere the night before.</p>
      <p>Amid it all, the rains intensified and then came the warning: heavy rainfall, landslides, and poor visibility on the roads. My family, reluctant to leave me alone in this state, had reached out to the only person nearby who could help: the lady who lived uphill on the Graham's Home Road. I wasn’t quite thrilled about the idea of even visiting her place, let alone staying there for a couple of hours.</p>
      <p>She was a figure of intrigue in Kalimpong—a woman shrouded in mystery, and everyone in our town had their version of her story. Her polished demeanour and well-kept appearance only served as a testament to those rumours. I had seen her before. Kalimpong was a small town, and no matter how hard someone tried to blend you, you can always notice.</p>
      <p>The lady seemed too refined, in contrast to the rustic life in Kalimpong. And so, the stories about her grew even more. Rumours took root like weeds in the slow-moving life of Kalimpong, where people had little else to entertain themselves with. It was easier for the townsfolk to pull stories from the air and justify their speculations as fact rather than confront the truth they knew little about.</p>
      <p>By late afternoon, my father had called her, and before I could oppose that decision, I was already standing at her front door, with an umbrella in one hand and a small bag that carried my essentials in the other.</p>
      <p>Her villa sat there, quiet, like a relic from another time. It wasn’t dilapidated, but it felt... faded.</p>
      <p>I knocked on the huge wooden door in front of me.</p>
      <p>The door opened after a while. And there she was in front of me, the woman in her late fifties. Her brown hair with patches of grey was pulled back, elegantly, into a neat bun. Her clothes were simple but elegant. An ash grey cardigan was placed elegantly over her shoulders.</p>
      <p>“Come inside,” she said, in a tone that wasn’t quite welcoming, but not exactly repulsive.</p>
      <p>I stepped in.</p>
      <p>The interiors of the villa felt…old, but well-preserved. One can say that the house had its glory in its prime. Heavy curtains hung down from the windows, a Kashmiri rug lay on the floor, and a fireplace crackled softly in the corner of the hall. The furniture, though elegant, had dulled over years of use without any polish.</p>
      <p>The walls were adorned with paintings. They were delicate and hand-painted scenes that seemed to be from another world. They were paintings of people, of women, mostly, in traditional attire. The colours had faded, but one could still make out the fine details.</p>
      <p>“Those are Kathiawad women,” she said suddenly, following my gaze. Her voice had a slight sadness, one that I couldn’t quite get. “The women in the paintings. They are from Kathiawad. The place where I was born.”</p>
      <p>I nodded, not sure of what to say.</p>
      <p>“Please, sit,” she said, directing my way towards an armchair, and then went inside a room.</p>
      <p>The air inside was filled with a faint scent of something sweet. After a while, she came back with a small tray in her hands. She offered me some muffins and a cup of hot milk. The warmth of the drink was welcoming, and the strong aroma of cinnamon from it filled the air with its sweetness.</p>
      <p>“It is needed, when the rain is pouring this heavily,” she said, sitting down across from me. A pinewood table stood beside her, with a few books stacked on top—books that looked worn, read not once but many times.</p>
      <p>I glanced at the covers. Yukio Mishima’s book, The Sailor Who Fell From Grace with the Sea. Natsume Soseki’s book Kokoro, and the book The Housekeeper and the Professor by Yoko Ogawa. All authors I had seen on Ama’s shelf, but never read them, except for one—Haruki Murakami’s Norwegian Wood. My English teacher, Miss Maya, had once recommended it. I remembered her telling us how it dealt with love, loss, and the labyrinth of human emotion, though at the time, I didn’t care. But when I took it from Ama’s belongings, I couldn't help but read it in one sitting.</p>
      <p>“So, do you like reading?” the lady asked in a soft voice.</p>
      <p>I flinched at the sudden question, realizing how long I had been staring at them. “A little,” I mumbled, “but I haven’t read any of these. Except for Norwegian Wood... though I didn’t finish it.”</p>
      <p>She raised an eyebrow, a faint smile brimming at the corners of her lips. “I see. It’s not an easy book to finish if you can’t connect with its characters. But then, it grows on you.”</p>
      <p>I nodded lightly. “My mother used to love reading. She had all those titles with her, but Murakami was her favourite. I read it from her collection.”</p>
      <p>I took a sip from the hot drink, letting its warmth seep through my body.</p>
      <p>“Murakami is my favourite too,” she said, glancing at the books on the table. “There is something very unique about his characters. They need to be absorbed from within. They all live in a world of unresolved emotions, much like us.” She sighed and then said again, ”Isn’t it strange how a story about loss can feel so comforting at times?”</p>
      <p>I didn’t know what to say. Loss. It was something I understood too well. My parents got divorced when I was just eight, and I moved to live in Mumbai with my mother. She was a nurse there. But then, the COVID hit, and my mother was one of the victims. I came back to Kalimpong to live with my father and grandparents. I barely knew them before. It was like being thrown into a new life without any warning, and even after three years, I am still trying to adjust.</p>
      <p>I didn’t tell the lady any of this, though. Instead, I asked her. “Which character could you connect with more? Naoko…or Toru?</p>
      <p>“Both,” she said, her voice softer now. “Naoko,” she said after a pause, “she was extremely fragile, trapped firmly in her grief. She failed to move forward after the deaths of her close ones. And Toru on the other hand... he was always drifting, drifting away from people and from his emotions, not sure of where he belonged. They were both lost, in their own ways, unsure of how to cope. They are like the two sides of the same coin.”</p>
      <p>“I... I know what it’s like to drift,” I found myself saying. “To feel like you can never belong anywhere.”</p>
      <p>She looked into my eyes, and with a soft smile, she said. “Yes. We all have such moments, when we feel lost…and untethered. Unsure of where we belong.” She took a pause and said again, “But sometimes, in the confusing stillness of those moments, we find something that grounds us.”</p>
      <p>I wasn't sure of what she meant. Her words hung mid-air, fading into the crackle of the fireplace. The rain fell steadily outside. The world beyond its windows felt like it had been erased. I took a sip of my drink. Its heat has all been absorbed by my... hands. As I looked back at the lady, sitting elegantly in front of me, I began to wonder. Maybe she was more like the characters in those books, finding it difficult to fit into the world around her. But instead of crumbling under its weight, she pulled herself back, not because she was weak, but as an act of self-preservation. But something was suddenly very comforting in her company, something that made the loneliness of Kalimpong feel less suffocating.</p>
      <p>“Did you grow up in Kathiawad?” I asked, trying to start up a conversation.</p>
      <p>Her smile faded. “Yes,” she said softly, looking at those pictures on the wall. “But then I left for Singapore and... never went back there.”</p>
      <p>My curiosity drove me, and I asked, “Singapore?”</p>
      <p>“Yes,” she said folding her book on the lap. “I went there to complete my master’s in Genetics.”</p>
      <p>That caught my attention. “Genetics… In Singapore?” I echoed. “What was it like?”</p>
      <p>Her lips curved into a small smile as if she was pleased by my curiosity. “Singapore was... different. It was fast-paced, modern. A world that was totally different from what I knew back in Gujarat. And genetics, it had always fascinated me. I was curious to read the stories of every living being that was written in their DNA.”</p>
      <p>The striking passion in her eyes was evident. A spark that even time couldn't dim. “I completed my studies and then became a lecturer at a university in Delhi.”</p>
      <p>“Delhi?” I found myself asking again. “But then, how did you come to Kalimpong?”</p>
      <p>“My husband. He was from Kalimpong,” she said, almost to herself. “I met him while I was in Singapore. He was studying business there. We got married despite our family’s disapproval.” She said with a sly but proud smile. “They thought I was making a mistake, leaving everything behind to follow him here.”</p>
      <p>She paused, fixing her gaze on the window. The rain was still pouring outside as if it had no intention of stopping. I took the last sip from my cup. I wanted to ask her more, but wasn't too sure of what to say.</p>
      <p>“So…what happened to him? Your husband?” I asked her softly, my voice brimming with anticipation.</p>
      <p>“One day, he received a call,” the lady continued. “He had to leave for Kolkata on some urgent business. That evening, too, the rains poured mercilessly. The next day, there was news of landslides everywhere. And he…never came back.”</p>
      <p>Her voice was calm, almost too calm, as she spoke of his disappearance. A chill ran down my spine. I felt a lump form in my throat when I asked, “Did they…did they not find him?”</p>
      <p>She shook her head and said. “No.”</p>
      <p>For a while, we sat in silence. The crackling of the fireplace and the drizzling rain outside filled the air between us.</p>
      <p>“Do you think... “ I tried to ask her. “Do you think we ever really heal?”, voicing a question that had been on my mind for years.</p>
      <p>She gazed at me for a while and said. “Healing. Healing is a very strange thing. Sometimes we don’t even realize that it is happening. We get through this day, and then the next, and before we know it, we have survived. But the scars, they always remain. We carry them with us wherever we go, whether we like it or not. But the only thing that really makes all the difference is our acceptance of those flaws. We accept those scars as a part of us, not trying to run from them.”</p>
      <p>Her words lingered in the air, heavy with truth. I thought about my own scars, the ones left by my mother’s death, by the sudden uprooting of my life from Mumbai to Kalimpong. I had never really dealt with them. I had just... survived the days.</p>
      <p>The clock chimed ten, and the relentless downpour had receded to a soft drizzle. Outside, I heard a car pull into the garage, and then the approaching voices of people. It was probably my family. They will now come to take me home.</p>
      <p>As I quietly waited for the knock on the door, I realised there was so much more to her world that the people ever tried to understand. I knew I would return here again, some other day, listening more to her stories. I finally found a spark, a company, a quiet hope in these hills I so desperately desired.</p>
