      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! My name is <strong> Adrija Chakrabarty.</strong> I'm an enthusiastic writer with a passion for storytelling, creativity, and exploring the world through words. When I'm not writing, you'll find me reading, strumming the guitar (just enough so the neighbours don't scream), watching movies, indulging in good food, capturing moments through photography, and discovering uncommon local places.
