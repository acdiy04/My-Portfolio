      <h1>The Forgotten Letter</h1>
      <div class="byline">by Adrija Chakrabarty</div>
      <p>
        The death of Renu Mathur may seem like an open-and-shut case, but it was not so simple in the eyes of Meenakshi Rao, the quiet and timid college librarian whom Renu befriended in her last days.
      </p>
      <p>
        Renu was found one early morning, in the backyard of her college campus near the four-storey high abandoned girls' hostel. The janitor discovered her body, lifeless, slumped face-down on the ground, arms placed neatly on the side, and with a deep wound on the back of her head. Some speculated she jumped from the terrace and bumped her head on the walkway slab near the huge old Neem tree. Some others with a taste for suspense speculated that she was murdered by her unknown lover. However, as per the official investigations, the case was quietly closed as a tragic case of suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meenakshi had always preferred the company of books over people. Ever since she was a child, she preferred detective thrillers over any other genre. Decades of surrounding herself with Hercule Poirot, Sherlock Holmes, and Philip Marlowe had shaped her wits to observe and deduce the subtlest that most overlooked. And so as she stood in the backyard, the exact spot where Renu’s lifeless body had been found a few days back. Her eyes traced through the scene carefully, meticulously, studying even the slightest detail that might have gone unnoticed.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, the position of the body. Renu had fallen face down, but the janitor had mentioned something strange that didn't fit quite well. “I didn't see much blood or injuries on her arms or legs,” he had said. “But at the back of her head…there was that big wound from where all that blood came.” Meenakshi looked up through the foliage of the Neem tree, its long, untamed branches spread everywhere, uninviting like a witch’s arms. Its branches loomed near one edge of the terrace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meenakshi narrowed her eyes. A fatal fall from a four-story height, on the slab, would have shattered most of her bones, and crushed her skull into pieces, not just leaving her with one deep and fatal head wound.
      </p>
      <p>
        She climbed up the stairs to the terrace.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was all quiet except for the distant murmuring of the students. A few leaves and twigs were scattered here and there. When she looked closely at one of the branches near the edge, she noticed a faint streak of blood. She lightly traced her fingers on the streak, then took a step back.
      </p>
      <p>
        “So…” Meenakshi told herself as if trying to piece it all together. “She didn’t directly fall on the slab, but hit the tree first.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Meenakshi returned to the library that afternoon, her mind racing with thoughts of Renu. Wouldn't the tree have reduced the impact of the fall, enough to save the life of the girl? Then how could she end up dead…and with a deadly wound on the head? And… if she indeed fell through the tree, then she would have fallen on the soft mud ground? Then why was her body found lying face-down on the slab?
      </p>
      <p>
        Meenakshi was convinced that there was more to the story. Her thoughts turned to the last interaction she had with Renu when she was sitting in the darkest corner of the library, sobbing and murmuring to herself.
      </p>
      <p>
        “She takes…everything from me,” Renu said, sobbing, gripping tightly on the edge of her desk. “Everything.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Who does?” Meenakshi asked her as she brought the Robert Chandler collection that Renu had been begging her to find for weeks. “Are you still angry with Sunaina for taking your place as the club representative?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Renu hesitated for a moment, her expression showed a mix of anger, fear, and regret. “Does it matter?” she said bitterly. “It’s all too late now anyway.” And then she left the library.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meenakshi wondered if she had pressed Renu to say her mind that day, then maybe this mishap could have been avoided.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day, Meenakshi decided to revisit the old hostel. She is certain that there were many more clues left behind that she might have missed before. On her way there, she encountered the janitor once more, and he shared something that confirmed her suspicions even more.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yes, madam, I am not lying," said the janitor. "That day, I saw Sunaina running right from where the girl was found. I didn't think much of it then. But then..." He looked around and lowered his voice. "The day before yesterday, Vaibhav ji called me and asked me not to tell the police anything about Sunaina. After that, the case was suddenly closed."
      </p>
      <p>
        "And...Madam, Renu was a really... lovely child. So I think...I need to tell you this." The janitor fidgeted his fingers, looked around, and hesitated before speaking further.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I tried to tell this to the police then...but..."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Benu ji, please don't hesitate, you can tell me." Meenakshi tried to assure the janitor.
      </p>
      <p>
        "When I first found Renu's body, there was a long stick...like a branch or something, right there, near the ground floor entrance. But, then...when I went back to call the guards, and the police came, I was informed that no such stick was found."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Are you sure about it?" Meenakshi said in a voice a little too loud for the students to notice them.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Absolutely, madam."
      </p>
      <p>
        After the janitor left, Meenakshi stayed near the base of the neem tree, observing any little hint that might have not been erased. Vaibhav Mathur's warning and Sunaina running away from this direction couldn't be all just for the sake of reputation. Sunaina...Sunaina Mathur, Vaibhav Mathur's, the dean's only daughter, and Renu's cousin. A third-year literature student, who had recently won the Scholar's Literary Award for her exceptional manuscript. But Meenakshi was aware of the silent tension between the two cousins. Renu had once admired Sunaina, but weeks before her death, something had soured that admiration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Renu would often tell Meenakshi, "She is not who you think she is."
      </p>
      <p>
        But Sunaina never seemed bothered. In fact, just a day after Renu's death, Meenakshi found her in the library reading, calm and composed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, something a few steps to the right of the base of the tree flickered in her eyes and made her jolt back to reality. Meenakshi went towards that thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        An earring.
      </p>
      <p>
        Did it belong to Renu?
      </p>
      <p>
        Meenakshi forced herself to remember hard, and then it suddenly clicked.
      </p>
      <p>
        The earring was indeed Renu's, and the police report mentioned them missing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meenakshi has almost solved this puzzle, but one important piece of it remains missing. How did Renu fall face-down on the slab, and what made Sunaina run away from the scene?
      </p>
      <p>
        That evening, Meenakshi spotted Sunaina walking in the corridors. "Sunaina, may I have a word with you?" she asked, approaching her.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yes, Ms. Rao,” Sunaina replied, retracing her steps toward the library.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Sunaina, I remember things were not going too well between you and Renu in the recent weeks. She even put a complaint in the box that you had plagiarized her work. May I know what that was about?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Sunaina frowned for a moment, gulping down her throat, and said. “Pla… plagiarism? What are you saying, Ms. Rao? Renu was…difficult. I am really sad... about what happened, but she always had this tendency to blame others when things didn’t work her way.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Blame others? About what?” Meenakshi questioned her.
      </p>
      <p>
        “You know, her usual insecurities. She couldn’t handle the competition. Always thought I had stolen something from her.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Meenakshi stood there quietly, trying to read the girl.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I am sorry, ma’am, but I have some work to do.” Saying this, Sunaina left off quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few days later, the Scholar Literary Society came to their campus to award the new prodigy of the literary world, Sunaina Mathur. She was brought to the stage and awarded a full scholarship to a prestigious university in the United Kingdom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meenakshi stood there in the crowd. The award Renu so desperately sought was going to be handed to Sunaina. Meenakshi suddenly recalled the day when Renu made her read the drafted manuscript before the final submission. She said, “Ms.Rao, this award has been my dream for years. This is my ticket towards freedom from all that oppression I faced for years living with Uncle.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Uncle? You mean Mr. Vaibhav Mathur and…Sunaina Mathur? But isn’t he your only guardian?” Meenakshi asked as she turned the pages of the manuscript, reading them carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I don’t really like Sunaina. She takes all my things. And Uncle…he always supports her and reprimands me…no matter who is at fault.” Renu said with innocence, but her voice had a bitterness in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, Meenakshi couldn’t help but smile at her innocent words. “It’s not like that. I am sure he cares for you, too. And by the way, this manuscript will surely secure you the scholarship.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The entire stadium suddenly clapped loudly as Sunaina took her award. Later, the audience was each distributed a copy of her published work.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the ceremony was over, Meenakshi came back to her desk. She began to read the work published under Sunaina’s name. To her utter surprise, it was exactly the work Renu made her read the other day, word by word. Meenakshi opened the soft copy of the manuscript that Renu had sent her to reassure her suspicions.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was right.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sunaina indeed took Renu’s work. She had to bring the truth to life? But what can she do? What authority does she have as a librarian? She decided to confront Sunaina first, hoping she would reveal the truth if she could bait her with the original manuscript.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next morning, Meenakshi called for Sunaina in her office. Surprisingly, she didn't have to put in much effort. The earring near the tree, the blood stains on its top branches, the janitor’s witnessing her run, the old manuscript, and a student’s confession who heard them quarreling that day near the girl’s hostel about a plagiarized manuscript were enough for Sunaina to reveal the entire truth of that night.
      </p>
      <p>
        But how could Meenakshi not reveal the truth to the authorities? Two days later, she submitted her resignation to the college administration, and an anonymous report to the board of directors and the commissioner in charge of the Police, mentioning every bit of evidence she gathered along with the incident as narrated by Sunaina.
      </p>
      <p>
        That night, Renu had called Sunaina on the terrace of the girls’ hostel. She threatened Sunaina that she would inform the higher authorities if Sunaina did not take back her submission. Feeling intimidated and cornered, Sunaina pushed Renu off the terrace on an impulse. After she hurried her way down the stairs, she saw Renu tumbling down from the huge neem tree. She was alive, but barely managed to stand up and walk. Scared at what she had done, she rushed back, crying, to her father’s cottage, located beside the hostel. Her father, who stole the original manuscript from Renu, asked her to wait inside the cottage. Scared and tired, she fell asleep there. A few hours later, when she woke up, she heard about Renu’s death and the police arriving on the campus. Late that night, Sunaina saw her father meeting the inspector who was in charge of the case, thanking him for saving his life.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the truth came out, the dean, Mr. Vaibhav Mathur, was arrested. Sunaina’s reputation was ruined, and she had to leave the college midway. A month later, after it all settled down, the Scholar Awards committee awarded Renu posthumously.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meenakshi returned to the world of her books by joining a public library. She wasn’t a detective, but with her sheer love for truth and the art of deduction, she solved a mystery that nobody dared to touch.
